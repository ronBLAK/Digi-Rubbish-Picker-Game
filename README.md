---YOU HAVE REACHED A REPOSITORY DEDICATED TO COMMITTING A UNITY 3D GAME CREATED BY A COLLEGE (HIGH SCHOOL) STUDENT (I AM AN ULTIMATE BEGINNER, SO PARDON ME IF YOU FIND ANY STRUCTURING MISTAKES IN THE CODING!!). THE TWO FILES ATTACHED TO THIS REPOSITORY ARE ALL THE CODING FOR THIS GAME AND THE MODELS USED IN THE GAME. TO OPEN THE MODELS, INSTEAD OF TRYING TO OPEN THE MODEL FILE WITHIN GITHUB, DOWNLOAD THE MODEL FILE ONTO UR MACHINE, ENSURE YOU HAVE BLENDER INSTALLED ON THE SAME MACHINE, AND OPEN THE DOWNLOADED MODEL FILE WITH BLENDER (P.S. YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THE SPECTULAR MODELLING THAT I MYSELF CREATED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE THIS GAME üòÄüòÄ (DEFINITELY NOT ME TRYING TO SHOW OFF)). I AM ALSO NEW TO GITHUB, SO IF STUFF IS NOT WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE NORMALLY FOUND, FORGIVE ME (ALSO P.S. THIS GAME TOOK ME AROUND 3 TERMS TO FINISH (AROUND 7 MONTHS (INCLUDING CREATING ALL THE MODELS THROUGH BLENDER)!!!))---
